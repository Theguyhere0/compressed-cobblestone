# Quick info for compressed-cobblestone
A Minecraft plugin that overhauls the game based completely on cobblestone!

Go to the [**wiki**](https://github.com/Theguyhere0/compressed-cobblestone/wiki) for more information.<br>
Go to the [**SpigotMC**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/compressed-cobblestone.82112/) page for the jar download.

This is my first Minecraft plugin that I created, so bear with me as I improve my skills.
I made this plugin as a Java exercise as well as just something to occupy my time during the 2020 pandemic.
Anyways, hope you guys find this fun!
